# Python Two-Player Pong Game

## Introduction
This Python-based project is a classic two-player Pong game. Each player controls a paddle on either side of the screen with the objective of deflecting a ball that moves autonomously across the field. If a player fails to hit the ball, their opponent scores a point. The game is built using the versatile turtle graphics module in Python, providing a simple yet engaging graphical interface.

## Game Controls
- **Left Player:**
  - `W`: Move paddle up
  - `S`: Move paddle down
- **Right Player:**
  - `Up Arrow`: Move paddle up
  - `Down Arrow`: Move paddle down

## Features
- **Simple Controls:** Each player uses just two keys to control their paddle.
- **Scoring System:** The game keeps track of each player's score, updating it as the game progresses.
- **Dynamic Ball Movement:** The ball speeds up slightly with each paddle hit, increasing the challenge.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** Run the Python script to launch the game in a new window.
2. **Control Your Paddle:** Use your assigned keys to move your paddle up and down.
3. **Score Points:** Aim to hit the ball with your paddle to keep it from passing you and scoring a point for your opponent.
4. **Win the Game:** The game continues indefinitely. You can keep track of scores and set your own winning conditions, like the first player to reach 10 points.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python `turtle` module (typically included in standard Python installations)
